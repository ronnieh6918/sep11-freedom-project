* **Problem-Solving** - When tinkering with my learning logs, one thing I think I did well is trying to think ways to learn from errors and making sure my app functions properly. I remember during my most recent learning log, I had to go back to my code and made sure that when user inputs guesses that are not 6 letters, it shouldn't appear into the history array and shown in the history log. This way, it allows user to repeat their 6 letter guess making it consistent even if when they accidentally had typos with their original guess. 
* **Creativity** - A lot of my learning log is trying to focus on how to improve my wordle remix. I want to be able to expand this further and once I'm able to make a simple wordle app, I want to try adding in difficulty levels like users can pick their guess up to a 7 letter word. There is so much to do that I can try to improve like adding in a separate page when user can select their preference, and I want to try incoperating all of this while also considering how I would design this in the future.
